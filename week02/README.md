# HW Week 2
### Check ClassTracker for Due Dates

## Study Group Assignment:
**See ClassTracker for your Study Group Members**

### 1. [Product Cards](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/exercise-vault/blob/master/HTML_CSS_product_cards.md) - Due Jul 21, 2020
- **Each** person should create a github assignment repo named `ASSIGNMENT-product-cards`
-  **Each** person should create a local folder in this location: `~/workspace/foundations/exercises/product-cards`. 
- You should be using flexbox. 
- Decide as a team how many branches you will need and what will happen on each branch (remember one feature per branch).

## Individual Assignment(s) - Due by June 19, 2020:
1.  Have 30 repos (test1-test30). Each of these repos should live here: `~/workspace/foundations/exercises`.  DO NOT DO ALL REPOS ON THE SAME DAY.  Maximum of 5 repos per day.  Each repo should have:
    * Each repo should start with a README.md file that you push to master branch
    * Each repo should have a setup branch. This branch should have 3 files - index.html, main.css, and main.js. The index.html file should have html boilerplate, link to the CSS file, script tag to the JS file. The css file should change the background color.  The JS file should have a console.log of your choice
    * There should be PR from the setup branch to the master branch
    * Before you merge the PR - your code should be properly indented and clean (consistent appropriate spacing)
    * Final result for a repo should have everything merged into master
    * If you mess up on one, skip it and move on, adding to your final number of completed repos. i.e. if you mess up test05, move on to test06, and at the end of this end up with test01-test31 pushed up to GitHub, skipping test05 (the one you messed up)

2.  [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - yep you get to play a game for your HW!
3.  (optional) [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=en_US)  - great visual way of learning about git branching
