# HW Week 3
## Study Group Assignment:
1. [Pet Adoption](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/pet-adoption) - Talk through how you are going to do the coding then do the coding individually.
  * The Buttons/Filters are bonus goals/extra credit for this one (since we haven't gone over this in class yet). Feel free to give it a go, but it's not required

## Individual Assignment
1. [Personal Site Part 1](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/personal-bio-site-instructions/blob/master/personal-bio-site-01.md) - Talk through how you are going to do the JS looping and then each person does their own.
1. OPTIONAL - [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/2nd-ed/get-started/README.md). This is a great additional resource for learning JS.
