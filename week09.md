# Week 9

1. Webpack Practice!!!!
- Make 5 repos, one a day, with all the new Webpack Hotness setup. At the end you should be able to `npm start` and see your background changed, a `h1` with a message, and a `console.error()` in the console. This is our New Setup, so practice is important. Just like what you did with the old repos, but this time doing all the Webpack stuff we did on Monday

2. [Tamagotchi](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/exercise-vault/blob/master/MODULES_tamagotchi.md) - discuss with your group your approach, but do the coding on your own
